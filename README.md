Authors: Ioana C. Butu, Dong An, Ben O'Shaughnessy

This repository contains code to perform simulations of SNARE-mediated fusion between two 50 nm vesicles, analyze the simulation data, and generate the technical figures for the paper "How SNARE proteins generate force to fuse membranes" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2025.01.015).
